# User research
## Target audience
The target audience in my case could be divided into three main groups, parents, business owners, and policymakers. For the first group, I would more likely target them with visualization as they can relate to the issue more than any other party and there are higher chances of them connecting to the problem and helping with donations. As for the second group, they are an integral part of the global issue of child labor are they are part of the supply chain that utilizes children in employment. Lastly, I would consider policymakers as the most important target audience as they have power over the previous two groups to make laws that prohibit any good that is associated with child labor anywhere in the world. 

## Approach to choosing interviewees
My approach to choosing the interviews is a bit different than the target audience because reaching out to business owners who work with global supply chains or policymakers is not feasible. So, I will be mostly targeting CMU students but from different backgrounds, the first student is translation master’s student, 27 years old (user 1), the second is a public policy student program and comes from a country with known child labor violations, 29 Years old (user2) and the this is a mother and a computer science student who works with data on daily basis, 33 years old (user 3). Even though this group doesn’t totally represent the target audience, I believe this is a diverse group that can give me insightful feedback about the story and its intended goals.
