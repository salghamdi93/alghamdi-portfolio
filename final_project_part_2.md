# User research
## Target audience
The target audience in my case could be divided into three main groups, parents, business owners, and policymakers. For the first group, I would more likely target them with visualization as they can relate to the issue more than any other party and there are higher chances of them connecting to the problem and helping with donations. As for the second group, they are an integral part of the global issue of child labor are they are part of the supply chain that utilizes children in employment. Lastly, I would consider policymakers as the most important target audience as they have power over the previous two groups to make laws that prohibit any good that is associated with child labor anywhere in the world. 

## Approach to choosing interviewees
My approach to choosing the interviews is a bit different than the target audience because reaching out to business owners who work with global supply chains or policymakers is not feasible. So, I will be mostly targeting CMU students but from different backgrounds, the first student is translation master’s student, 27 years old (user 1), the second is a public policy student program and comes from a country with known child labor violations, 29 Years old (user2) and the this is a mother and a computer science student who works with data on daily basis, 33 years old (user 3). Even though this group doesn’t totally represent the target audience, I believe this is a diverse group that can give me insightful feedback about the story and its intended goals.

## Interview script

### Q 1) Just in a couple of words, what do you think the story is about?	
User 1: Throughout the story, we learn about child labor around the world.	
User 2: Educating about child labor encourages viewers to make an impactful change.
User 3: It is about the pressing issue of child labor. It explores its causes, history, status, and possible solutions. 

### Q 2) Would you suggest any changes to the content, visual or written?
User 1: For the visual content in the "Let's change the image" section, here are my thoughts. 
This might be me a trivial issue, but can you change the children to have normal things a child should have (like books, fruit, toys, … etc.) instead of them vanishing? To me, when a character's image vanishes like that, it represents them dying. I'm sure if that is not the intended message but if you can change it would be a visual change that might evoke users' emotion since they see the end goal. Or
Let them go to school instead of going to work.  
If not, I suggest rephrasing the message. Here are some examples from the top of my head: Let's change their stories, let's end child labor. 

I'm not sure about this assertion title, 

"Child labor fight globally stuck since 2016" 

If it supposed to mean that the global pushback against child labor has been stuck, maybe "stuck" here is not the accurate term since it has increased by around 10 million since 2016.
Also, I was a bit confused since the bar chart indicate the number of children in employment while the assertion title is reporting the fight against it. I would suggest changing it to something like: Children employment numbers has increased in 2021. Or adding more data representing the global pushback. 

User 2: I really like this visualization, but I’d suggest using “1” in place of “a” to make it more impactful and coherent with the phrase “every 10 children” precedes it. Also, maybe consider shrinking the image and allow viewers to capture the whole essence of the message in one glance. Now I need to scan my eyes left to right. Additionally, I don’t know if this is possible but maybe considering visualizing the “labor” child not looking very cheerful? (arms down, or just ignore arms). I think this will be more impactful. (she refers to the graph about 1 children out of 10 is engaged in labor)

Maybe clarify this a little bit - “160 million children are forced to work”. As for visualization, my opinion is that green is a happy and peaceful color. I do not resonate with the hazardous condition at first when I see this. I’d say maybe consider brownish or grayish.
Again, I’d say try not to use green. Green is happy!


-	Can make it more relatable by adding - “approx xx hours every minute passed” (referring for the time counter board).
-	I don’t quite understand this one. (referring to the child labor hours graph). I personally would add the traffic of the production destinations here. Because people who read this mainly are anywhere else, and people who you might aim to educate are probably one of the destinations. Maybe add something like “Products from these countries are exported to xx% Country A, xx% Country B”. (for worst countries for child labor graph). Should this be a percentage? How is this weighted? By hours spent, finished products, or dollars? (for the graph about the goods associated with child labor)

-	Are these % by country? (for the poverty graph)
Kids look so happy here I feel bad to delete them from a seemingly nice environment! (for the photo with the three kids)
-	Add some quantitative impact the viewer could make. “Every 100 less child labor product purchase could help blah blah blah” (for the text about let’s change the image)<br>

<b>User 3</b>: I am confused about the image of persons shape with a background, both visually and the test. The graph with the good associated with child labor has numbers that are not explained. The possible future is with no source. Reversing years of progress slide is ambiguous. And there are some missing years in the bar chart. 


### Q 3) Did any part confuse you? If yes, please let me know what parts and why did it make you feel confused?

User 1: I'm not sure about this assertion title, 

"Child labor fight globally stuck since 2016" 

If it supposed to mean that the global pushback against child labor has been stuck, maybe "stuck" here is not the accurate term since it has increased by around 10 million since 2016.
Also, I was a bit confused since the bar chart indicate the number of children in employment while the assertion title is reporting the fight against it. I would suggest changing it to something like: Children employment numbers has increased in 2021. Or adding more data representing the global pushback. 

User 2: -	Can make it more relatable by adding - “approx xx hours every minute passed” (referring for the time counter board).

-	  Add some quantitative impact the viewer could make. “Every 100 less child labor product purchase could help blah blah blah” (for the text about let’s change the image)

User 3: Goods associated with child labor by country section. I didn’t understand the numbers under each good. Also there is no country in the graph.

### Q 4)	What did you like the most about the story?
User 1: There was something really touching about the story of the Nepali child. By reading these children's stories and viewing their statistics, I believe users will be motivated to empathize with them.
User 2: I like the impactful images and transitions. Removing children from the labor scene and stuff.
User 3: It is generally great, I liked the richness of information and the graphics. I particularly loved the slide with the example of a child selling vegetables to eat.

### Q 5) Is there any element you would suggest removing?
User 1: No
User 2: I think all of them are fine to have. Some might be a bit more “number and stats” but people who aren’t into numbers will just scroll past, and those who do will read. So it’s fine as is.
User 3: Not necessarily remove but the section titled ‘possible future’ seemed not necessary. It raises the question of what is this based on? Also it is a concerning issue as is (I didn’t feel like more children significantly changes perspective, it is VERY disturbing as it is)

### Q 6) Do you think the data visualizations supported the story?
User 1: Yes
User 2: Yes
User 3: Yes very much

### Q 7)Is there anything else that you would like to see regarding this topic that would help you connect more with the story?
User 1: A more in-depth look at the stories of children will make a powerful impact. As well, I wonder if the story can feature success stories of initiatives that helped some children escape this grim situation.
User 2: I would want to see something relatable to the viewers and how their action could be impactful.
User 3: Perhaps what efforts were done in the past to improve? Why did it stop?

### Q 8) Did you feel like you wanted to take an action by either donating or downloading the app?
User 1: Yes indeed. It might be a good idea to add a download button for the app. 
User 2: Yes
User 3: To some extent, the donation was stronger though cause I didn’t feel a direct correlation between the app and the issue. How is this app helpful?


## User research: findings
### Based on user 1 feedback:
-	I will change the title of the graph titled “child fight labor stuck since 2016” as we can clearly see from the graphs that it actually increased. So I would change it to something that conveys the idea of the rate increase for the first time in two decades.
-	I will also try to include a story about specific children who were exploited in labor rather than just mentioning numbers and stats.
-	I could mention also how previous efforts changed the child labor scene previously or be more tangible about how the donation would affect children, like for example every 1 dollar donated could save 1 hour of hard labor for 3 children.
-	Adding a button to download the app. 
### Based on user 2 feedback:
-	I will change the title of the graph about that fact of 1 child engaged in labor among every 10 children.
-	I will consider changing the position of the pictogram in the graph I mentioned in the previous point and also changing the icon. Flourish provided only this icon for me but I will see if I can customize one. 
-	For the circle chart about the number of children in child labor, I need to change the color as green in suggesting that these are positive facts and the same applies to the fight against child labor graph. 
-	The pictogram about child labor hours seems to confuse a lot of people so I will change its tile, and the colors used to better convey the idea of the comparison. 
-	I’m thinking about adding a network flow of products from Africa to the rest of the world to show how child labor is happening in Africa but we are all involved in child labor without knowing. 
-	The graph about goods associated with child labor also cause a lot of confusion and I need to revisit it to find a way to show that the numbers are the number of countries involved in child labor for that exact good.
-	For the images where the children vanishes, it seems the children seemed quite happy so I think it would be better to change the photo but keep the effect.
-	What impact the audience can make in numbers? I could contemplate more about this and find a way to better communicate it with the reader so they could see how their efforts would make a change. 
### Based on user 2 feedback:
-	There is definitely an issue with the graph about the good associated with child labor so I think I could change the chart type to a simpler one, I will experiment with the new tool we learned about in class today. 
-	The board with the child selling veggies got a lot of likes so I will keep it.
-	The intention of “reversing the progress” idea was not communicated clearly and was misinterpreted so I will change the title and try to use the effect to show the concept more clearly. I could possibly include the graph to explain the idea but remove the number from it.   
-	I will use the text more carefully to describe the idea of the app. 
-	The bar chart has some missing data, I will check for the reason and try to find the values.
