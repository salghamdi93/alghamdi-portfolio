# User research
## Target audience
The target audience in my case could be divided into three main groups, parents, business owners, and policymakers. For the first group, I would more likely target them with visualization as they can relate to the issue more than any other party and there are higher chances of them connecting to the problem and helping with donations. As for the second group, they are an integral part of the global issue of child labor are they are part of the supply chain that utilizes children in employment. Lastly, I would consider policymakers as the most important target audience as they have power over the previous two groups to make laws that prohibit any good that is associated with child labor anywhere in the world. 

## Approach to choosing interviewees
My approach to choosing the interviews is a bit different than the target audience because reaching out to business owners who work with global supply chains or policymakers is not feasible. So, I will be mostly targeting CMU students but from different backgrounds, the first student is translation master’s student, 27 years old (user 1), the second is a public policy student program and comes from a country with known child labor violations, 29 Years old (user2) and the this is a mother and a computer science student who works with data on daily basis, 33 years old (user 3). Even though this group doesn’t totally represent the target audience, I believe this is a diverse group that can give me insightful feedback about the story and its intended goals.

## Interview script

### Q 1) Just in a couple of words, what do you think the story is about?	
User 1: Throughout the story, we learn about child labor around the world.	
 User 2: Educating about child labor encourages viewers to make an impactful change.
 User 3: It is about the pressing issue of child labor. It explores its causes, history, status, and possible solutions. 

### Q 2) Would you suggest any changes to the content, visual or written?
 User 1: For the visual content in the "Let's change the image" section, here are my thoughts. 
This might be me a trivial issue, but can you change the children to have normal things a child should have (like books, fruit, toys, … etc.) instead of them vanishing? To me, when a character's image vanishes like that, it represents them dying. I'm sure if that is not the intended message but if you can change it would be a visual change that might evoke users' emotion since they see the end goal. Or
Let them go to school instead of going to work.  
If not, I suggest rephrasing the message. Here are some examples from the top of my head: Let's change their stories, let's end child labor. 

I'm not sure about this assertion title, 

"Child labor fight globally stuck since 2016" 

If it supposed to mean that the global pushback against child labor has been stuck, maybe "stuck" here is not the accurate term since it has increased by around 10 million since 2016.
Also, I was a bit confused since the bar chart indicate the number of children in employment while the assertion title is reporting the fight against it. I would suggest changing it to something like: Children employment numbers has increased in 2021. Or adding more data representing the global pushback. 

 User 2: I really like this visualization, but I’d suggest using “1” in place of “a” to make it more impactful and coherent with the phrase “every 10 children” precedes it. Also, maybe consider shrinking the image and allow viewers to capture the whole essence of the message in one glance. Now I need to scan my eyes left to right. Additionally, I don’t know if this is possible but maybe considering visualizing the “labor” child not looking very cheerful? (arms down, or just ignore arms). I think this will be more impactful. (she refers to the graph about 1 children out of 10 is engaged in labor)

Maybe clarify this a little bit - “160 million children are forced to work”. As for visualization, my opinion is that green is a happy and peaceful color. I do not resonate with the hazardous condition at first when I see this. I’d say maybe consider brownish or grayish.
Again, I’d say try not to use green. Green is happy!


-	Can make it more relatable by adding - “approx xx hours every minute passed” (referring for the time counter board).
-	I don’t quite understand this one. (referring to the child labor hours graph). I personally would add the traffic of the production destinations here. Because people who read this mainly are anywhere else, and people who you might aim to educate are probably one of the destinations. Maybe add something like “Products from these countries are exported to xx% Country A, xx% Country B”. (for worst countries for child labor graph). Should this be a percentage? How is this weighted? By hours spent, finished products, or dollars? (for the graph about the goods associated with child labor)

-	Are these % by country? (for the poverty graph)
Kids look so happy here I feel bad to delete them from a seemingly nice environment! (for the photo with the three kids)
-	Add some quantitative impact the viewer could make. “Every 100 less child labor product purchase could help blah blah blah” (for the text about let’s change the image)
 User 3: I am confused about the image of persons shape with a background, both visually and the test. The graph with the good associated with child labor has numbers that are not explained. The possible future is with no source. Reversing years of progress slide is ambiguous. And there are some missing years in the bar chart. 


### Q 3) Did any part confuse you? If yes, please let me know what parts and why did it make you feel confused?
