# Project Part I

# Outline

Global child labor refers to the practice of employing children in work that is harmful to their physical, mental, social, or moral development. Despite being illegal in many countries, child labor is a widespread and complex issue that affects millions of children worldwide. Children engaged in labor often work long hours in hazardous conditions, including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. This practice is fueled by a range of factors, including poverty, lack of access to education, and weak labor laws. The consequences of child labor are severe and long-lasting, ranging from increased risk of injury, lower educational attainment, and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Although efforts to eliminate child labor have been ongoing, progress has been slow, and much work remains to be done. 

In this project, I want to emphasize the shocking facts about child labor around the world and how it’s still with us after all these years. According to sources, it’s estimated that one out of every seven children is impacted by child labor. A global estimate suggests that there are 218 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 who engage in some form of labor. Out of this total, 152 million children are forced to work under dangerous conditions.   The number of children in labor was gradually decreasing for decades until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the globe which led to the first increase in two decades- an increase of 8.4 million children.   I also want to highlight the relationship between poverty and child labor in a way that shows how countries with the highest poverty rate are the same countries with the highest child exploitation rates. Moreover, I would like to discuss the spillover effects of pandemics, crises, or wars on child labor and the family’s need for additional income courses. 

# Project Structure
Setup: 
After all these years, global child labor is still a major issue in the world that still deprive children of their basic rights.
Conflict:
* How many children are in child labor? And how many work in the hazardous situation?
* What’s the proportion of children engaged in labor by country?
* What’s the trend for the global number of children in labor? 
* The gold of the UN is to end child labor in 2025. What’s the projection with the current situation?
* In Bangladesh, children as young as 6 works up to 110 hours a week + Average weekly working hours of children
* How many Hours of child labor in the world this year so far? (real-time counter)
* What are the worst forms of child labor?
* What does children work in? The agriculture sector bears the majority of child labor, accounting for 70% of cases. Globally, it is estimated that 108 million children work on farms and plantations.
* What are the goods that are most commonly associated with child labor across countries?
* “I must work to eat” how does crisis affect child labor?
o	Approximately 60% of families who have fled from Syria and are currently living in host communities depend on the income earned by their children.
o	The COVID-19 pandemic has put an estimated nine million more children at risk of being forced into child labor by the end of 2022.
* UN experts urge action to address the alarming increase of child labor in the agriculture sector. “The Call emphasizes the need for urgent action because the COVID-19 pandemic, armed conflicts, along with food, humanitarian and climate change threaten to reverse years of progress against child labor.” 
Resolution:
How can we help end child labor? Tips and policy recommendations.

# Method and medium 
I would need to do more work on writing the text that will be along with the graphs and to decide what the topic and headlines will be. I also plan to use Shorthand to showcase the story, so I need to do more work on finding appropriate images and graphics that help in story flow and meaning.
