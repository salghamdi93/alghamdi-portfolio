# Outline
Global child labor refers to the practice of employing children in work that is harmful to their physical, mental, social, or moral development. Despite being illegal in many countries, child labor is a widespread and complex issue that affects millions of children worldwide. Children engaged in labor often work long hours in hazardous conditions, including agriculture, mining, and manufacturing. This practice is fueled by a range of factors, including poverty, lack of access to education, and weak labor laws. The consequences of child labor are severe and long-lasting, ranging from increased risk of injury, lower educational attainment, and perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Although efforts to eliminate child labor have been ongoing, progress has been slow, and much work remains to be done. 
In this project, I want to emphasize the shocking facts about child labor around the world and how it’s still with us after all these years. According to sources, it’s estimated that one out of every seven children is impacted by child labor. A global estimate suggests that there are 218 million children between the ages of 5 and 17 who engage in some form of labor. Out of this total, 152 million children are forced to work under dangerous conditions.   The number of children in labor was gradually decreasing for decades until the Covid-19 pandemic hit the globe which led to the first increase in two decades- an increase of 8.4 million children.   I also want to highlight the relationship between poverty and child labor in a way that shows how countries with the highest poverty rate are the same countries with the highest child exploitation rates. Moreover, I would like to discuss the spillover effects of pandemics, crises, or wars on child labor and the family’s need for additional income courses.
