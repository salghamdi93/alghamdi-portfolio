# Inflation Visualization

## Step one: finding a data visualization
I chose the first visualization in the following article. Title: Watching inflation.

## Step two: critiquing the data visualization
The primary goal of this visualization was to show how inflation trends and prices for each month compared to the same time a year earlier for a group of commodities. However, in the subtitle, it says “See year over year price changes for major categories of goods” and this suggests that the visualization tracks the changes over different years while it actually only compares the change in inflation rate between the years 2021 and 2022. This was one of the first observations that confused me about the chart. What stood out to me was the use of shape and color, it was very eye-catching and the interactivity made it engaging to an extent. 
#### What worked?
I would say that this visualization did a good aesthetically, even though it is a regular heat map but the use of warm two main colors and the padding between the squares made it pleasant and easy to the eye and unique. It was easy to follow too where all the focus goes to the color gradient representing the value of the percentage change. The visualization is also very intuitive, familiar, and easy to follow with generally clear labels. 
In terms of visualizations usefulness, it provides information that is useful for the audience as it shows the exact percentage change in inflation from the earlier year for each category over every month in 2022.  I would also argue that it was engaging and encouraging to interact with it but no the extent that push the audience to engage with the information itself due to some perceptibility I will discuss next. 
#### What didn’t work?
In terms of perceptibility, even though the visualization attempts to show the overall increase and decrease trend in inflation percentage change, it fails drastically in showing the degree of the change from month to month. It’s impossible for the human eye to distinguish between the different shades used for the squares when the value is anything between 21% to 57%. They are using almost exactly the same shade and there is no way to see if the value is changing from 25% to 50% or from 51% to 52% between months unless you press on the square to see the value. Moreover, there is no way to see the value of the percentage change from one category to the other, for example, in terms of magnitude, we can’t compare inflation percentage change over the months between different categories like Gas or Housing costs because all of the squares are of the same size. 
#### What would I change?
I will attempt to find another chart type that better suit the data I have. Even though I like the minimal use of the two colors in the graph, but I would use another color pallet to better distinguish categories. The use of the heatmap here is aesthetically nice but it limits the amount of important information that needs to be communicated so I would change the type of charts used to other like bars or area chart that use utilize the same space but provides more information with the use of colors and shapes.
 I will also attempt to change the subtitle to make it clear that between the years 2021 and 2022. The change in inflation magnitude between the months must be emphasized with the use of other shapes, so I will make sure to use a graph that shows this feature of the data like an area chart or bar chart grid. I would remove the repletion of the ’22 in every month in the X-axis label. If I needed to use the legend, I would change it to make it the shades better reflect the change magnitude rather than having one shade for all values +15% (dark brown) or -10% (light blue). I would definitely make sure to use a different color for each category so the audience could easily track the change in each one of them. 
Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?
The primary audience is the average person with no specific background in economics and who is interested in knowing what’s happening to the prices of main commodities, gas, and electricity.  Due to all of the problems I discussed before, I don’t think the visualization is succeeding in showing insightful information about the inflation change magnitude and rather only shows that 3 of the categories witnessed an extreme increase in inflation compared to the earlier year. It makes it very hard to the audience to track down the numbers or know the upward or downward trends when the change is gradual. What if the person is interested in the change of clothing costs, the whole row has almost the same color and he would not be able to even know if the inflation percentage change is increasing or decreasing when it actually decreased from 6.6% to 2.9% from February to December.

#### Final thoughts
The method is actually very effective, it helped me a lot to think about what otherwise wouldn’t be part of my assessment thought process. I also like how the method specifies how two metrics like usefulness and completeness are different from each other while aesthetics and engagement could overlap. Also, considering the distinction between the informational side of the visualization and then measuring the audience’s emotions towards the visualizations is a very interesting approach that allowed me to think differently about the process of creating a visual story. 
I would suggest a metric that tries to measure the trade-off between violating standards of conventions and perceptibility and when it can accept to go beyond the conventions. In the visualization I have, I would say using a heatmap to show the inflation rate is against the convention and it wasn’t used in favor of the data. Perceptibility would be lost with this unconventional use so the vote would go against using a heat map. 
Another one would be measuring the time spent by an average person to get the main idea of the visualizations. A threshold like for example 20 seconds would be used to set an acceptable time where more than the threshold would mean that the visualization needs to be adjusted or redesigned. Moreover, this metric would need a group of people to participate in order to capture the metric value. For this metric, the visualization would get a high score since it can be grasped within 20 seconds.

## Step four: Test the solution
Questions Asked
- Can you tell me what you think this is?
- Can you describe to me what this is telling you?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?

Person 1: A student, 28. Her description of the graph content was very accurate, she was able to understand it quickly but couldn’t identify a story to tell me about what was happening in the chart. The feedback I got was that the title was not very informative and didn’t reflect any specific message. She wasn’t sure what was the purpose of the graph or what it represents. She also mentioned that it was not hard to understand the graph and follow along. She liked how easy it was to follow the lines and know what categories we were tracing. The use of colors didn’t make her focus on any specific category but just the overall trend She also mentioned that she would remove the repetition of the word inflation in the y-axis and would try to focus on one of the word categories rather than all of them. She assumed the audience was general news readers as the topic is interesting to many people especially those ages 25-60 and who are financially responsible for families or breadwinners.  Lastly, she was confused about why January data was missing.
Person 2: An engineer, 30. He explained the idea of the graph correctly, but he also made comments about the title of the graph. They were not negative comments but he asked clarification questions which made me again question the title. He didn’t like how the lines were overlapping a lot, he said it confused him and that the colors didn’t help in making it any easier. Another point he raised is that he didn’t know what the space between the months represents, he asked if they were actual days data or just fillers. Moreover, he said it was hard to follow the month up to see the exact percentage value for any given month. He suggested using pointers or markers or adding a grid. There was confusion too about which year we are discussing and that x-axis could be used to point out the year. 
What I learned from the conversations
It seems to me that mainly there is a problem with the title and its meaning so I will need to contemplate more on the message being delivered and create a new title. Even though the first person likes the way the lines were drawn but the second person wanted a more direct way of identifying the difference between the percentage among all of the categories that could be realized a first glance. And for this, I would experiment with different graphs that represent the area and see how the data fits. Both interviewees had suggestions about the colors, I focused on the color distinction, but I didn’t realize that the colors are so bright that every line screams for attention.  As for the January data missingness, I couldn’t find the reason why it was missing from the original visualization so I will go back to the data source and include it in the results. Additionally, I like the suggestion about the pointers, so I would definitely add one for each month. Also, for accuracy, I would add the footer that the in-between the months doesn’t represent daily data.

## Step five (part 2): Build your solution

During our Monday class, I also got a lot of useful feedback for my above visualization. I got a comment about the title of the graph and the subtitle stating that more information needed to be included so it’s clearer that the number represents percentage change. The alignment of the title was also something that was discussed, it was suggested to align the title with the y-axis label. It was also mentioned that the y-axis was very confusing since the number doesn’t represent the actual value next to the line due to the fact that it’s an area chart. It also seemed to me that they thought that the area overlaps due to the color shades I used. Additionally, the sudden decrease in the gas inflation percentage change didn’t make sense to the whole group so I would have to change the order of my categories to make it more intuitive. It was also suggested to add a sentence about how the area represents the change to make it clear that they don’t overlap. The grid was also with not actual value to the viewers and they suggested removing it.
