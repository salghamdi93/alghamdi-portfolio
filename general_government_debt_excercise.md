## Different Visualizations Of General Government Debt Data From OECD

### Visualization 1 : (Bar chart)
This is a custom visualization for the different countries based on OECD data.

### Visualization 2: (Grid of line charts)
Here is another visualiztion of the same data from OECD about general government debt using line chart in a grid.

### Visualization 3: (Column chart: stacked)
Lastly, here is yet another visualiztion of the same data from OECD using stacked chart type with highlighting of sepcific countries.

## Discussion
For the following graphs, I used general government debt-to-GDP ratio data from the OECD which measures the gross debt of the general government as a percentage of GDP.For the first visualization, I have limited the time series to include data from the year 2021 for all countries. The chart in my opinion is easy to follow with good color choice and its interactive nature made it very easy to grasp the information it provides. 

Visualization two separates the chart into a grid where there is a separate chart for every country to better focus on each one individually and it has more data since it tracks all countries from 1995 until 2021. However, you can see the overall trend of the government debt for each country but it’s hard to see the real values for each year. It’s not clear what the y-axis present which is a huge drawback in the chart’s clarity that also suffers from the nonexistent of a title. The interactivity makes up for some of its flaws but it’s lacking as it’s impossible to know the debt ratio unless you scroll through the line. 

I used a column chart (stacked) for my third visualization because I noticed how it emphasizes the proportional change/persistence of the debt ratio over time for each country. Since I used flourish, it took a while for me to change the strucutre of the data to match the chart type setting. The chart attemps to highlight some of the countries while keeping the other unlabeled countries’ data for comparison reasons even when they are unidentified. My justification here would be that ,usually when economic data is used, the reason would be to compare the performance of one or a couple of countries and that’s why I thought the stacked chart could be a meaningful choice.However, one things I would like to add is to enable interactive coloring if the user wanted to see the data for one of the greyed out countries but I couldn't find this attribute in Flourish.
